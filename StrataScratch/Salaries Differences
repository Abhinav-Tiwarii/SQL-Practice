with cte as 
(
select d.id,d.department, max(e.salary) as max_mar_sal from db_employee e 
join db_dept d 
on e.department_id = d.id
group by d.id,d.department
having d.department = 'marketing')

select d.id,d.department, max(e.salary) as max_eng_sal from db_employee e 
join db_dept d 
on e.department_id = d.id
group by d.id,d.department
