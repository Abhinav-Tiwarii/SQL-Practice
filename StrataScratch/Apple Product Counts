select pu.language, 
count(distinct case when pe.device in ('macbook pro', 'iphone 5s', 'ipad air')
then pe.user_id end) as n_apple_users,
count(distinct pu.user_id) as n_total_users
from playbook_users pu join playbook_events pe
on pu.user_id = pe.user_id
group by pu.language
order by n_total_users desc;
